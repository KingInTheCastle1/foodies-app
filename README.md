This small project is an Android application targeted towards UNCG students to help them find food around campus.

There are 3 basic modes of operation: setting preferences for food, selecting a random restaurant from a list based on preferences, and selecting the best restaurant that fits the user's preferences.

This is done in Java using Android Studio with Android emulators.
